                        Maratha clan. Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom from the declining Adilshahi
                        sultanate
                        of
                        Bijapur that formed the genesis of the Maratha Empire. In 1674, he was formally crowned the
                        Chhatrapati
                        of his realm at Raigad Fort.

                    <h3>Birth of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</h3>
                    <p>
                        Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was born at the fort on 19 February 1630 (some accounts place it
                        1627),
                        and spent his
                        childhood there. Inside the fort is a small temple dedicated to the goddess Shivai Devi, after
                        whom
                        Shivaji was named. The English traveller Fraze visited the fort in 1673 and found it invincible.
                        According to his accounts, the fort was well-stocked to feed thousand families for seven years.
                        The
                        fort came under the control of the British Rule in 1820 after the Third Anglo-Maratha
                        War.

                        In 2021, it was added to the tentative list of the UNESCO World Heritage sites as part of
                        "Serial
                        Nomination of Maratha Military Architecture in Maharashtra"

                    <h3 id="info-header">Coronation Ceremony</h3>
                    <p>
                        The preparation for the proposed coronation began in 1673. However, some controversial problems
                        delayed the coronation by almost a year. Controversy erupted amongst the Brahmins of
                        Shivaji's
                        court: they refused to crown Shivaji as a king because that status was reserved for those of the
                        kshatriya (warrior) varna in Hindu society.Shivaji was descended from a line of headmen of
                        farming villages, and the Brahmins accordingly categorised him as being of the shudra
                        (cultivator)
                        varna. They noted that Shivaji had never had a sacred thread ceremony, and did not
                        wear
                        the thread, which a kshatriya would. Shivaji summoned Gaga Bhatt, a pandit of Varanasi, who
                        stated that he had found a genealogy proving that Shivaji was descended from the Sisodias, and
                        thus
                        indeed a kshatriya, albeit one in need of the ceremonies befitting his rank. To enforce
                        this
                        status, Shivaji was given a sacred thread ceremony, and remarried his spouses under the Vedic
                        rites
                        expected of a kshatriya.

                    <h3 id="info-header">Chhtrapati Shivaji Maharaj Mode Of Warfare</h3>
                    <p>
                        Chhtrapati Shivaji Maharaj maintained a small but effective standing army. The core of Shivaji's
                        army consisted of
                        peasants of the Maratha and Kunbi castes. Shivaji was aware of the limitations of his army.
                        He
                        realised that
                        conventional warfare methods were inadequate to confront the big, well-trained cavalry of the
                        Mughals which was equipped with field artillery. As a result, Shivaji adopted guerilla tactics
                        which
                        became known as 'Ganimi Kawa'.
                        Shivaji Maharaj was a master of guerrilla warfare. His strategies consistently perplexed
                        and
                        defeated
                        armies sent against him. He realized that the most vulnerable point of the large, slow-moving
                        armies
                        of the time was supply.
                        He utilised knowledge of the local terrain and the superior mobility of his light cavalry to cut
                        off
                        supplies to the enemy. Shivaji Maharaj refused to confront in pitched battles. Instead, he
                        lured the
                        enemies in difficult hills and jungles of his own choosing, catching them at a disadvantage and
                        routing them.
                        Shivaji Maharaj didn't stick to a particular tactic but used several methods to undermine his
                        enemies as
                        required by circumstances, like sudden raids, sweeps and ambushes and use of psychological
                        pressure.
