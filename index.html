            <p> <b>Shivaji Raje Bhosale</b> (19 February 1630 â€“ 3 April1680), also referred to as, <b>Chhatrapati
                    Shivaji
                    Maharaj</b>,
                was an
                Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle
                Maratha clan. Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of
                Bijapur that formed the genesis of the Maratha Empire. In 1674, he was formally crowned the Chhatrapati
                of his realm at Raigad Fort.

                Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire,
                the Sultanate of Golkonda, Sultanate of Bijapur and the European colonial powers. Shivaji's military
                forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming a Maratha
                navy. Shivaji established a competent and progressive civil rule with well-structured administrative
                organisations. He revived ancient Hindu political traditions, court conventions and promoted the usage
                of the Marathi and Sanskrit languages, replacing Persian in court and administration.</p>
